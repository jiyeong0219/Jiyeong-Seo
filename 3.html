        <p>   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language
          that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time
          compiled and multi-paradigm. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation and
          first-class functions.

          Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.
           Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,[13] often incorporating
            third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execut
            e the code on the user's device.

          As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative
          programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text,
           dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
